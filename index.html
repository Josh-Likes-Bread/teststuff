    <p id="text">I think Vera van de Seyp’s work is amazing, I love her process, how she mixes mediums and creates her own tools. I relate a lot to her kind of work as I also like mixing mediums and, funnily enough, I recently started making my own tools for personal projects. Additionally, the way she explained her process also really resonated with me. She talked about how she likes to deconstruct and really understand how a system works so that she can then use those systems later. As a designer, I feel like I can recognize myself in that kind of process as that is pretty much how I like to work; I like to try and understand a process or create systems that I can then use to generate what I need and different systems are suited for different needs. 

        That search for understanding, figuring out how something works or simply just learning something new is what I love most about design. The feeling I get when I figure out a new system is the high I constantly chase in graphic design. I wonder, however, how much of my career as a graphic designer will be dedicated to learning or experimenting with new systems. from my short experience so far, commercial graphic design work actually requires minimal exploration. It seems like clients are more interested in following a certain trend and I have also noticed that at times, speed tends to be more valued than innovation. This is why I think Vera‘s work is so interesting because she has managed to blend and incorporate her exploratory practice with her commercial work. Obviously not every design can do what Vera van de Seyp does, but perhaps looking at her practice might help me figure out a system that works for me. At the very least, her work was inspiring as it made me think if she can do all these cool things, then perhaps so can we.
